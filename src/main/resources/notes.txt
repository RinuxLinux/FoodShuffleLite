4. The src/main Directory
As the name indicates, src/main is the most important directory of a Maven project. Anything that is supposed to be part of an artifact, be it a jar or war, should be present here.

Its subdirectories are:

src/main/java – Java source code for the artifact

src/main/resources – configuration files and others such as i18n files, per-environment configuration files, and XML configurations

src/main/webapp – for web applications, contains resources like JavaScript, CSS, HTML files, view templates, and images

src/main/filters – contains files that inject values into configuration properties in the resources folder during the build phase
